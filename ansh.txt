Loves to be appreciated…Smart Worker…Always in search of new things, friends & perception…!!!|||What is life about?Life is all about “unfulfilled desires”.Each one of us has one or the other desire which remains unfulfilled.As soon as we fulfill a desire,we realize a new desire and we join the race to achieve the same.And the life goes on.It's really wonderful to keep struggling to achieve our one or the other desire but with a pinch of caution that our desire shouldn't be against the mankind.Thanks!!|||Who's the worst victim of reservation?This is the most impressive question I've encountered today.According to me, the worst victims of Indian Reservation System is that General Category Candidate.Who has missed to compete IIT/JEE MAINS just by 1 mark,but his fellow who has access to even more facilities than him, has competed it even by scoring 20 marks less than him. As, he/she belonged to SC/ST/OBC category.(I faced this.)Who works hard day & night to compete UPSC but is not given chance to take mains because he couldn't clear his category cutoff.Who has informed his mother about his new job but later comes to know that his job was no more as an OBC Candidate was given greater priority.Who dreams to study in colleges like SRCC or Stephens but couldn't live his dream because he scored 98.4% and General Category Cutoff was 98.6%.Who didn't get ticket from political party because that party preferred a guy from lower caste to increase Dalit Vote Bank.Who has competed UPSC in his last attempt and he still didn't get IAS just by 1 rank . Irony lies here!! When he sees other candidate whose general rank is even greater than him gets IAS just because his category rank is 1.In short,all those people who work hard to achieve something very great in their life but couldn't do so because they were rejected from one or the other place and get sad to see their friends achieving great heights by scoring even less than them, are the worst victim of Indian Reservation System.Thanks!!By physical problem if you refer to those persons with disability then let me tell you every govt. Exams either for job or institutions,there are seats reserved for PWD.|||what are your most controversial opinion?I have an unpopular opinion on the social evil of society - “DOWRY”.What people consider as Dowry?Dowry is cash or in kinds whatever is asked by boy's family before the deal is finalized.(So sad to call marriage a “deal” but that's what society has made it.)But this is only technical meaning of dowry. If you see it through the metaphorical lens,it's not limited only to cash or gifts.Now,What I consider as dowry?Dowry is all those mental pressure or I would say mental extortion which the girl’s family has to bear through out the whole process of marriage.This is a syndrome which doesn't let bride's parents enjoy the process rather they are nervous that what the groom's family say. I will term this syndrome as so called “Ladke Waale Syndrome”I call it so as now a days one who doesn't fit in the first definition,consider themselves so elite & develop such superiority complex as if they have done a favour by not asking a dowry.May be cases of technical “dowry” would be extinct from the society one or the other decade.But,the tough job is to get rid of this so called “Ladke Waale Syndrome”.And,for this we need a behavioral change to remove the “patriarchal mindset ” from the society.Each & every guy should take an onus to remove this syndrome.They should nudge their family to ensure that bride's father enjoy her “princess wedding”.Unfortunately, today's grooms are party to it.There may be one or two exceptional guy who would have nudged their family in such a way that there was no sense of superiority complex in the marriage.I haven't met any such guy yet.Have you met?As far as I know our society,your reply would also be in negation.No issues, let the search go on.!!And,if you are an unmarried guy,congrats your search is over!! Be the one,take the onus & bring transformation in the society.Make the princess’ father feel that he is getting her daughter married to a prince.Thanks!!
