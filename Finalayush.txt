Loves to be appreciated…Smart Worker…Always in search of new things, friends & perception…!!!|||Who's the worst victim of reservation?This is the most impressive question I've encountered today.According to me, the worst victims of Indian Reservation System is that General Category Candidate.Who has missed to compete IIT/JEE MAINS just by 1 mark,but his fellow who has access to even more facilities than him, has competed it even by scoring 20 marks less than him. As, he/she belonged to SC/ST/OBC category.(I faced this.)Who works hard day & night to compete UPSC but is not given chance to take mains because he couldn't clear his category cutoff.Who has informed his mother about his new job but later comes to know that his job was no more as an OBC Candidate was given greater priority.Who dreams to study in colleges like SRCC or Stephens but couldn't live his dream because he scored 98.4% and General Category Cutoff was 98.6%.Who didn't get ticket from political party because that party preferred a guy from lower caste to increase Dalit Vote Bank.Who has competed UPSC in his last attempt and he still didn't get IAS just by 1 rank . Irony lies here!! When he sees other candidate whose general rank is even greater than him gets IAS just because his category rank is 1.In short,all those people who work hard to achieve something very great in their life but couldn't do so because they were rejected from one or the other place and get sad to see their friends achieving great heights by scoring even less than them, are the worst victim of Indian Reservation System.Thanks!!By physical problem if you refer to those persons with disability then let me tell you every govt. Exams either for job or institutions,there are seats reserved for PWD.|||what are your most controversial opinion?I have an unpopular opinion on the social evil of society - “DOWRY”.What people consider as Dowry?Dowry is cash or in kinds whatever is asked by boy's family before the deal is finalized.(So sad to call marriage a “deal” but that's what society has made it.)But this is only technical meaning of dowry. If you see it through the metaphorical lens,it's not limited only to cash or gifts.Now,What I consider as dowry?Dowry is all those mental pressure or I would say mental extortion which the girl’s family has to bear through out the whole process of marriage.This is a syndrome which doesn't let bride's parents enjoy the process rather they are nervous that what the groom's family say. I will term this syndrome as so called “Ladke Waale Syndrome”I call it so as now a days one who doesn't fit in the first definition,consider themselves so elite & develop such superiority complex as if they have done a favour by not asking a dowry.May be cases of technical “dowry” would be extinct from the society one or the other decade.But,the tough job is to get rid of this so called “Ladke Waale Syndrome”.And,for this we need a behavioral change to remove the “patriarchal mindset ” from the society.Each & every guy should take an onus to remove this syndrome.They should nudge their family to ensure that bride's father enjoy her “princess wedding”.Unfortunately, today's grooms are party to it.There may be one or two exceptional guy who would have nudged their family in such a way that there was no sense of superiority complex in the marriage.I haven't met any such guy yet.Have you met?As far as I know our society,your reply would also be in negation.No issues, let the search go on.!!And,if you are an unmarried guy,congrats your search is over!! Be the one,take the onus & bring transformation in the society.Make the princess’ father feel that he is getting her daughter married to a prince.Thanks!!|||What is life about?Life is all about “unfulfilled desires”.Each one of us has one or the other desire which remains unfulfilled.As soon as we fulfill a desire,we realize a new desire and we join the race to achieve the same.And the life goes on.It's really wonderful to keep struggling to achieve our one or the other desire but with a pinch of caution that our desire shouldn't be against the mankind.Thanks!!|||How's your life?Being generic, there can be multiple dimensions to this answer depending on multiple perspectives of multiple individuals answering one of the multiple questions on Quora.There can be a person earning a meagre amount who is happy because he is able to get what he wants,coz he is satisfied with what he has.He helps everyone under his capabilityHis happiness is not dependent on a companion so he enjoys his own companyHe works hard whole day & promises to work little more on the next day.Also there can be a person who is a millionaire but not in peace because He recently lost the 10 Crore deal.He is ditched by his 3rd girlfriend.He works hard not for the satisfaction but to crack a deal to add more no. Of zeros to his income.There are always 2 kinds of children in our society,say A & B ,A always scored little more than passing marks and B always topped in class but after 10th board.A celebrates even after scoring 60% and B cries even after scoring 96% just because she was not the topper.How's one's life is a subjective question with no concrete dimension.It depends on my expectations from life depending on my capability.If I achieve it I'm the happiest otherwise the saddest.So,what actually matters is not how's my life but how I want to see my life .I can be most successful in the eyes of world yet the saddest just because I am fighting with my own insecurities.And,this is reason why the batsman like Maxwell,who is perceived to be happiest by many, going through depression.Even in ancient period,King Ashoka was victorious in many wars but after Kalinga War when he saw his people in pain & grief,he realized that he lost even after winning.He was so affected by his agony & pain that he ultimately left the war and chose peaceful & virtuous life.At last I would say we should just fight for our inner peace every single day,every single hour,every single minute.If we are able to achieve that ,we will certainly be happy .|||And ultimately,we will head a step towards SELF ACTUALISATION.|||most motivating line ever:Some of the one-liners are :Self Confidence is like a bud inside you just let this bud blossom to spread the essence of success in your life.|||Sometimes,your dream don't let you sleep.If you don't sleep for that dream,believe me friend you are soon going to make that dream a reality.|||Life is just like a cricket match.Everyone gets a single golden ball.Now the choice relies on us,Either we hit a six & let the world cherish us Or we miss it, eventually, giving the world a chance to hit us.|||When you think you're alone, you're not really alone.|||Rather you have packet of 10% desire,20% deep thoughts & 70% hardcore determination to fight back in the next shot.|||These are written by me, when I think deeply about life.|||Thanks!!
